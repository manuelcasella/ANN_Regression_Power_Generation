# ANN_Regression_Power_Generation
Google_Colab Notebook showing the use of an Artificial Neural Network to predict Power Generation values

Based on the "Combined Cycle Power Prod" Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and the "ANN for Regression" Course from Hadelin de Ponteves, the following notebook shows how to apply the ANN using TensorFlow and Keras, and the comparison of the predicted vs real_test values
