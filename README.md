# ANN_Regression_Power_Generation
Google_Colab Notebook showing the use of an Artificial Neural Network to predict Power Generation values

Based on the "Combined Cycle Power Prod" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the following notebook shows how to apply the ANN using TensorFlow and Keras, and the comparison of the predicted vs real_test values
